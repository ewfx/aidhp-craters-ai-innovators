## 🎯 Introduction
This project is a Flask-based intelligent recommendation system that leverages machine learning (ML), vector databases, and large language models (LLMs) to provide personalized financial recommendations. It predicts a customer's likelihood of applying for a home loan and generates tailored suggestions for home loans or investment products based on their financial profile and retrieved knowledge.

The purpose of this project is to address the lack of personalization in financial services by combining predictive analytics with context-aware recommendations. By integrating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, the system ensures that recommendations are both relevant and actionable.

## 💡 Inspiration
   The inspiration for this project stems from the growing need for personalized financial services in the banking and financial sector. Customers today expect tailored recommendations that align with their unique financial profiles, goals, and circumstances. Traditional financial systems often rely on static rules or generic advice, which fails to address individual needs effectively.

   This project aims to bridge that gap by leveraging machine learning (ML), vector databases, and large language models (LLMs) to provide context-aware, personalized financial recommendations.

## ⚙️ What It Does
Key Features and Functionalities of the Project
   This project is a Flask-based REST API that predicts a customer's likelihood of applying for a home loan and generates personalized financial recommendations using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Below are the key features and functionalities:

1. **Home Loan Prediction**
   **Functionality:**
   Predicts whether a customer is "Likely to apply" or "Unlikely to apply" for a home loan based on their profile data.
   **How It Works:**
   A pre-trained machine learning model (home_loan_model.pkl) is used for prediction.
   Customer data is preprocessed:
   Missing values are filled with default values.
   Categorical features are encoded using pre-trained label encoders.
   Numerical features are scaled using a pre-trained scaler.

2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
   Functionality:
   Retrieves relevant context from a vector database (Chroma) to enhance the recommendations generated by the LLM.
   How It Works:
   Based on the prediction:
   If "Likely to apply," the system queries the vector store for Home Lending Products.
   If "Unlikely to apply," the system queries the vector store for Investment Products.
   The retrieved documents are used as context for the LLM to generate more informed recommendations.

3. **Personalized Recommendations**
   Functionality:
   Generates tailored financial recommendations using a Large Language Model (LLM).
   How It Works:
   The LLM (e.g., Llama) is invoked with a detailed prompt containing:
   Customer profile data.
   Retrieved context from the vector database.
   Recommendations are:
   Home Loan Options (if "Likely to apply").
   Investment Product Options (if "Unlikely to apply").
   The recommendations are concise, relevant, and tailored to the customer's profile.

4. **REST API Endpoint**
   Endpoint: /api/predict_home_loan
   Method: POST
   Input:
   Customer profile data in JSON format, including fields like age, income, account balance, employment status, etc.
   Output:
   A JSON response containing:
   Home Loan Likelihood: "Likely to apply" or "Unlikely to apply."
   Recommendations: A list of 3 personalized financial product suggestions.

5. **Vector Database Integration**
   Functionality:
   Stores and retrieves document embeddings for context-aware recommendations.
   How It Works:
   Uses Chroma as the vector database.
   Embeddings are generated using Hugging Face's sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model.
   The similarity_search method retrieves the most relevant documents based on the query.

6. **Machine Learning Integration**
   Functionality:
   Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict home loan likelihood.
   How It Works:
   The model is loaded using joblib.
   Preprocessing steps include:
   Encoding categorical features.
   Scaling numerical features.
   The prediction output is used to determine the type of recommendations to generate.

7. **Large Language Model (LLM) Integration**
   Functionality:
   Generates human-like recommendations based on customer data and retrieved context.
   How It Works:
   The LLM (e.g., Llama) is initialized using LangChain's init_chat_model.
   A detailed prompt is constructed with customer data and retrieved context.
   The LLM generates recommendations in a structured format.

8. **Data Preprocessing**
   Functionality:
   Ensures customer data is clean and ready for prediction.
   How It Works:
   Missing values are replaced with default values.
   Categorical features are encoded using pre-trained label encoders.
   Numerical features are scaled using a pre-trained scaler.

9. **Environment Management**
   Functionality:
   Manages sensitive information like API keys using environment variables.
   How It Works:
   Uses dotenv to load environment variables from a .env file (e.g., Hugging Face API key).

10. **Debugging and Logging**
   Functionality:
   Provides detailed logs for debugging and monitoring.
   How It Works:
   Logs key steps, such as:
   Adding documents to the vector store.
   Retrieving context from the vector store.
   Generating recommendations using the LLM.

**Example Workflow**
   Input:
   A customer submits their profile (e.g., age, income, account balance) via the /api/predict_home_loan endpoint.
   Prediction:
   The ML model predicts whether the customer is "Likely to apply" or "Unlikely to apply" for a home loan.
   Context Retrieval:
   Relevant documents (e.g., home loan or investment products) are retrieved from the vector database.
   Recommendation Generation:
   The LLM generates 3 personalized recommendations based on the profile and retrieved context.
   Output:
   The API returns the prediction and recommendations in JSON format.

**Key Benefits**
   Combines machine learning, vector databases, and LLMs for intelligent, context-aware recommendations.
   Provides a scalable and modular architecture for financial recommendation systems.
